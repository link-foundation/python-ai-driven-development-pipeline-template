"""Behaviour tests for the execution-budget wrapper (issue #60).

A job killed by ``timeout-minutes`` is reported by GitHub as **cancelled**, not
**failed**, so on a pull request a genuine timeout only produces a warning. The
wrapper exists to take the deadline away from the runner: it must terminate the
whole process tree of an overrun, annotate it as an error naming the budget, and
exit 124 like ``timeout(1)`` so the job concludes ``failure``.
