# Prove the release credentials can write before any expensive job runs.
#
# Principle 16 of the shared CI/CD best practices ("Prove You Can Publish
# Before You Build", issues #74 and #77). A non-empty secret proves nothing
# (an expired token is non-empty), and a login -- or a registry token
# endpoint -- proves authentication, not authorisation: auth.docker.io
# answers an anonymous pull,push request with 200 and silently narrows the
# grant to pull. The only form of the check that is not a guess is an
# attempted write:
#   - PyPI trusted publishing: exchange the workflow's OIDC token for a
#     short-lived upload token at /_/oidc/mint-token -- exactly what the
#     publish step does. Nothing is uploaded.
#   - Docker Hub: POST /v2/<repo>/blobs/uploads/ -> 202 opens an upload
#     session, DELETE cancels it, nothing is stored and no tag moves.
#
# PREFLIGHT_MODE:
#   release -- push to main / manual instant release. A refused credential
#              fails the run here, before the publishing job spends a minute.
#   report  -- pull requests, where a fork legitimately has no publishing
#              secrets. The same probes run and annotate, but never block.
#
# Rules each caller depends on (each is a defect if dropped):
#   1. Report every failure, not the first -- no probe aborts the script.
#   2. Report `unknown`, never a guess: a timeout or a 429 has not said the
#      credential is broken. But a release-mode run that verified nothing is
#      not a pass.
#   3. Probe with a write, not a login.
#
# No set -e on purpose: rule 1 means one failed probe must not hide the rest.
